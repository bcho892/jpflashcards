This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## jpFlashCards

You can try out the app [here](https://main--cute-ganache-272be3.netlify.app/)

A tool I have made that can help one practice their Japanese reading skills.

The data is provided using an API in which I have set up that scrapes [yourei.jp](https://yourei.jp/) and [dictionary.goo.ne.jp](https://dictionary.goo.ne.jp/). The flashcards and collection of cards is connected to a Firestore database.
